README AndroidUploadApp

This project consists of a simple Android app that demonstrates image
file upload via HTTP Post. The file may be uploaded either in simple
raw form or Base64 encoded in JSON format.

The project also includes code for a simple upload web server written
in Java in the Spring MVC framework. The app and the server were built
in the Eclipse based Springsource Tool Suite.

The image file is uploaded from the app running in the Android emulator 
to the upload server all running on the same box.

This example code is pretty bare bones at this point, but perusing the
code should make it clear what's going on and enhancements like a file
picker or some post upload processing are simple to add. And I am quite
certain that this is not the best or most efficient way to code this.

This code is a simple Thank You to everyone who posted code and tutorials
that got me to this point.
